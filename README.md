# hello-world
My first repository

I am starting a journey of learning. I will be learning to code, solve problems, and most of all
about myself. I will be learning over the next few months just how far I can push myself, and that 
is very exciting. I can't wait to read back over this file in 6 months and look back on how far I've
come. Let the adventure begin!
